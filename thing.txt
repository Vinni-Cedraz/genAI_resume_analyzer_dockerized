There have been automatized resume screening systems based on keywords for a
long time.

But traditional ATS systems are a black box both to the recruiters and the
candidates. They are also expensive and unavailable to small to medium
businesses which are often doing things the old fashioned way, which might be
more humane, but is certainly time-consuming.

ClearHire offers a gain in productivity while still leaving the human in the
loop.

By providing feedback we are using AI to help humans be more humane.

We are using technology to create a cultural change here, in the
positive direction. Given how rare it is to get any feedback at all, and
even rarer to get a GOOD feedback.

Technologies I used: LLaMa, Groq, Flask, Chromadb, Langchain, Streamlit,
Docker, Docker-compose

Techniques: RAG, prompt engineering with xml tags, CoT and a simple Agentic
Flow.

Models:
- llama3.2 3b for name recognition
- llama3.2 70b for sumarizing the most relevant chunks
- llama3.2 90b for providing feedback

Next Steps:
- deploying on oracle cloud for scalability
- using crew ai to make agentic flow cleaner, smarter and scalable
- include a preliminar step with an agent that will rank the top 10%-15%
  resumes that are more compatible to a job description by semantic similarity
  and other techniques.
