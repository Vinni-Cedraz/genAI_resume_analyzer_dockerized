My project uses a RAG with generative AI to help recruiters extract relevant
information from a batch of candidate resumes that was already filtered with AI
from a bigger batch according to the requirements of the job description.

Then, after the hiring is done, I'll feed another AI agent with all the queries
from the recruiter along with the last agent's answers so that this other agent
can use all this context to generate personalized feedback to each one of the
candidates that weren't hired.

I'm using Groq with Llama because the free tier is very generous and it's speed
is what makes the process feasible since it has to go through a lot of data to
generate the answer and especially the feedback. This will focus at first on
small to medium companies who do not have automatized hiring systems (or even
an HR sector at times), so keeping the cost low by using opensource tools
matters a lot.

I'm convinced, however, that this could provide a better solution than the
tradition ATS systems who are not humane and transparent so in the future this
could scale to attend bigger companies!
